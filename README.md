# Valenthia-UE5

## Project description
It's a collaborative and open-source role-playing game made with Unreal Engine 5. It's designed to be played solo. 
Every passionate person can contribute to the project, gathered to breathe life into a realm of infinite possibilities: Developers, game designers, artists, modellers, sound designers...

Inspired by legendary fantasy realms such as Game of Thrones, World of Warcraft, or Lord of the Rings. The game unfolds with elements of mysticism, intrigue, and fantasy. The player's story takes shape as a simple adventurer embarking on epic quests, kingdoms clashing in fierce battles, and ancient mysteries waiting to be unravelled.

The story of this universe is also a collaborative one. You can follow its development here:
